Detection Framework with Dark Knowledge

This project tend to build a CNN based detection framework which contrains two steps


1. Localization

Instead of the traditional Selective Search framework, We plan to use a CNN network to generate the candidate bounding boxs. We hope our BBox generating precedure will take the advantage of the context information and the co-existence of the other objects.

To overcome the potential overfitting problem, we plan to introduce the Dark Knowledge trick into our trainning procedure. Hope it will cause a better result.


2. Classification

This is a mainly traditional classification CNN framework. The improvement we want to do is taking the context output of the localization layer into consideration and make the classifier become a context awareness classifier.
